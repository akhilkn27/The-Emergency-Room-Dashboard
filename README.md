# The-Emergency-Room-Dashboard

I'm delighted to announce the launch of my latest Tableau dashboard ✈, titled "The Emergency Room Dashboard 🏥".

This dashboard offers insights into various aspects including 📝:-

🏷 Total number of Patients visited.

🏷 Percentage of Gender distribution among total Patients.

🏷 Average waiting time for Patient admission.

🏷 Average Patient satisfaction rating.

🏷 Distribution of Patients across different age groups.

🏷 Breakdown of Patient demographics by race.

🏷 Average number of Patients arriving on time.

🏷 Total number of referrals across different Departments.

Special thanks to Joshua Matlock - MHA, CPHQ for his guidance on this project 👨‍🏫.
